## Instructions on how to install and run the web application.

To run the application on your local machine, open your cmd terminal in a folder and run the following commands sequentially:

- `git clone https://github.com/chuksjoe/quidax-books-2.git`
- `cd quidax-books-2`
- `npm install` or `yarn install`
- `npm run start` or `yarn start`

## Requirements to run the application

- Node JS: Minimum Version 14.0.0

## Any assumptions you have made about any part of the assessment. We would like to see your thought process and explanations.

I used SCSS for styling the header component and the sub-components in it as listed below:
- [Header](https://github.com/chuksjoe/quidax-books-2/blob/main/src/components/Header.jsx)
- [SearchInput](https://github.com/chuksjoe/quidax-books-2/blob/main/src/components/SearchInput.jsx)
- [SearchInputSmall](https://github.com/chuksjoe/quidax-books-2/blob/main/src/components/SearchInputSmall.jsx)

I also used SCSS for some other part of the project like the book card container and the utility classes.

But due to time constriant and my work schedule, I'm not able to style the whole project without Tailwind-css.
